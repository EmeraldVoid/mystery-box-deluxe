Mystery Box Deluxe is a randomizer that will randomly generate a randomized seed file for you to use with the [Goemon Randomizer](https://github.com/abyssonym/mn64rando) by [abyssonym](https://www.github.com/abyssonym).

The project got its name because it is a randomizer for a randomizer. Couple that with the fact that seeds are random from person to person (even if using the same settings), and it just adds to the random chaos. It is a silly tool that I made purely for the fun of chaos.

The seeds this tool generates may or may not work. I am just pumping them out for fun and thought I would share them with you. Give this little application a try.

**Be sure to get the latest release!**

## Note
This script was written for use with the Windows download and not the `.py` version of the randomizer.

## Installation & Usage

### Step 1: Download
Head over to the [latest releases](www.google.com) to get the most up-to-date version. You can save this file anywhere, but it's recommended to place it in its own folder where you have the randomizer installed.

### Step 2: Launch the Script
Run `Mystery_Box_Deluxe.py` and wait. Use the following instructions based on your OS:

#### Windows
- Double-click the `.py` file if Python is correctly installed.
- Alternatively, open a terminal (`cmd` or `PowerShell`) and run:
  ```sh
  python Mystery_Box_Deluxe.py
  ```

#### Mac/Linux
- Open a terminal and navigate to the script's directory:
  ```sh
  cd /path/to/script
  ```
- Run the script:
  ```sh
  python3 Mystery_Box_Deluxe.py
  ```

### Step 3: Choose a Save Location
When prompted, type or paste the path to the folder where you want to save the output file.

#### Finding a Folder Path
- **Windows**: Shift + Right-click the folder → Select "Copy as path"
- **Mac**: Right-click the folder → Select "Get Info" → Copy the "Where" field
- **Linux**: Navigate to the folder in a terminal and use `pwd`

### Step 4: Copy the Output
- Navigate to the directory where your output text file is saved.
- Open the file and press `Ctrl + A`, then `Ctrl + C` to copy the text to your clipboard.

### Step 5: Modify mn64_settings.yaml
- Navigate to the location of your `mn64_settings.yaml` file.
- Press `Ctrl + A` to select all text.
- Press `Ctrl + V` to paste the new code.
- Press `Ctrl + S` to save.

### Step 6: Setup the Randomizer
Follow the setup directions for the [Goemon Randomizer](https://github.com/abyssonym/mn64rando).

### Step 7: Run the Randomizer
- Execute `mn64rando.exe` and wait.
- After the allotted time set by Mystery Box Deluxe, you will have a playable ROM with the randomized settings you created.

### Step 8: Enjoy!
Have fun with your randomized experience!
